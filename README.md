# FabricOS CLI Support README

FabricOS CLI Support contains what I consider to be the most important CLI commands for dealing with SAN-Switches. 
I created the collection to make my life easier when creating scripts with [PowerShell][] for [Visual Studio Code][].
I currently use [PowerShell][] Version 7.4.x for this purpose.

All commands you find here correspond to the commands you can find in the [Brocade FabricOS Command Reference Manual][]. Not all options for all commands are available here, but the most common ones should be available.
If you miss something please contact me.

## Requirements

Use [Visual Studio Code][] with recommendation in connection with the current [PowerShell][] module.

[PowerShell]: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell
[Visual Studio Code]: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode
[Brocade FabricOS Command Reference Manual]: https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/fibre-channel-networking/fabric-os/fabric-os-commands/9-2-x.html

## Known Issues

* Some tab stops do not work as desired
* Some explanations are not clear enough

## Release Notes

See [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for all changes and releases.

## Working with Markdown

Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.
